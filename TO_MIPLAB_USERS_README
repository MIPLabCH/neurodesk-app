This fork is meant to be used to deploy new neurodeskapp releases for the NX-421 class.
There are some changes done in this regard:

src/main/server.ts

In launchArgs, there are additional docker arguments:
--env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --volume="$HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority:rw"  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v /home/NX421/NX_NSSP_public:/home/jovyan/Labs -v /home/NX421/Data:/home/jovyan/Data'

These arguments are for the display, ie allowing an X11 forwarding through Docker to display FSLeyes in an interactive manner as well as other potential widgets in the future.
The other arguments are there to mount the data folder and the code folder directly so that it is exposed to the students seamlessly.

The other important modification in the launchArgs happens here: 
    launchArgs.push(arg.replace('{tag}', tag).replace('{tag}', tag).replace('vnmd/neurodesktop', 'shrecki/mipdock'));

Indeed, vnmd/neurodesktop is replaced with mipdock, which is a custom Docker image. You can find the Dockerfile to it in the root of this fork.
The idea is that in this docker image (built on top of neurodesktop), we put all relevant libraries for the class: it is where we install our Python dependencies, such that students do not need to ever worry about environment management.

To create a new neurodeskapp .deb to be deployed on the VM:

# First update the mipdock docker image 
# (Note to future TAs: you can create your own dockerhub repo, in which case shrecki/mipdock will need to be replaced accordingly)
# (Likewise, should neurodeskapp get some updates, you should change in the dockerfile and everywhere the version tag corresponding to neurodesktop)

docker system prune -a
docker build -f Dockerfile -t neurodeskapp:2024-05-25 .
docker tag neurodeskapp:2024-05-25 shrecki/mipdock:2024-05-25
docker push shrecki/mipdock:2024-05-25

# Then build the new .deb file, using yarn (if you do not have it, you must install it obviously)
yarn
yarn run clean && yarn build
yarn dist:linux

# Now you should see in the dist/ folder a NeurodeskApp.deb file. This is the one that should be sent to the VM group
# (Probably Mme. Ionescu)
# To install this file on the VM, a VM administrator should do on the main image sudo dpkg -i /path/to/NeurodeskApp.deb
